# GoLink
A Go-based link shortener that requires a key to create links.

## To use
To use the link shortener, compile the go files. Run the resulting executable. It will give you a key to use. Log on to your website and you will see a form, asking for a key and a URL. If you input both successfully, it should return a short URL. The URLs should be in the form hostname/xxxx, where xxxx is a 4 letter combination.
